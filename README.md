# GettingAndCleaningDataProject

This is a R programming project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" Coursera course.

The program (run_analysis.R) will take the initially provided files and do various processing on them to output the resulting file tidyData.txt.
This will contain the mean and STD of each type of data for each subject and activity type pair. 

The raw data, while not terribly interesting in my opinion, is a collection of test and training data for Samsung Galaxy S smartphones.

Feel free to use this repository as you wish, though if you are taking the Coursera course yourself, it is against the terms of the course
to copy others work.
